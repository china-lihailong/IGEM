                                    <p>The organizer, Doug Mohr, invited us to one of Stanford buildings. Yet on the parking I met Roman Chadnov, my friend from Tomsk. We entered the building and asked where the event was. It turned out that there were several of them. Finally we found out the garden mainly thick of young people in jeans and t-shirts who got together and didn’t pay attention to others. Many of them had badges of Google and Facebook members. Our!</p>

                                    <p>In the far end of the garden there was a bar which, however, was not so popular. Waiters scurried about the programmers and offered various snacks (mmm, tunny was amazing!!!). All people fastened on their badges (actually not to make the acquaintance of everyone) and sorted out, apparently, according to linguistic/geographical features. Russian group quickly became too much and divided into two. Also there were more than one Chinese group. </p>

                                    <p>Apart from expected friends (Andrey Lasarev, Artem Rahov and Sergei Rogulenko from Saratov; Slava Isenbaev, Roman Elizarov, Dmitriy Dgulgakov and others) I surprisingly met several people who also take part in ICPC: Ilya Mironov — Vice World Champion of 1998, a colleague from Google and well-known in narrow circles player in the «What?Where?When?».Alex Grusheckiy who sits in 10 meters away from me at work, also was among them. Of course, you can guess that the team from Vitalik Goldstein and Petit Mitrichev coincidentally is not gathering.</p>
